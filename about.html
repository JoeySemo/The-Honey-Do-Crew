      <h2>Our Story</h2>
      <p>The Helpful Hive began with a simple idea: neighbors helping neighbors. As busy parents and pet lovers ourselves, we realized how valuable an extra pair of hands can be when life gets hectic. We wanted to create a service that felt like calling a trusted friend who just happens to be really good at getting things done.</p>
      <p>Based in Wentzville and proudly serving St. Charles County, we've built our business around kindness, reliability and respect. Every job is an opportunity to make someone’s day a little better, whether we're cleaning up a kitchen, walking a dog or tackling a to-do list that keeps growing.</p>
      <h2>Our Values</h2>
      <ul class="values-list">
        <li><strong>Community First:</strong> We are your neighbors and always act with the heart of the community in mind.</li>
        <li><strong>Warmth & Trust:</strong> We treat your home, pets and belongings as if they were our own.</li>
        <li><strong>Quality & Care:</strong> We never cut corners and take pride in every task we take on.</li>
        <li><strong>Open Communication:</strong> You'll always know what to expect and can reach us directly by phone, email or DM.</li>
      </ul>
      <h2>Meet the Team</h2>
      <p>Our hive of helpers includes experienced cleaners, organizers, dog walkers and errand pros. What unites us is our passion for service and our genuine love for the community we work in. We're background checked, insured and trained in best practices for safety and efficiency.</p>
      <p>When we're not helping clients, you might see us volunteering, coaching local sports or cheering on our kids at school events. We love Wentzville and take pride in making it an even better place to live.</p>
      <p>If you'd like to know more about us or have any questions, don't hesitate to <a href="contact.html">get in touch</a>. We can't wait to meet you!</p>
